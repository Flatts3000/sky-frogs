### 🔵 Starter island spawns with a chest
SkyblockBuilder's built-in default island shipped a chest; Sky Frogs grants the first-launch kit via KubeJS instead. **Fix shipped (pending in-game verification):** the pack now ships a custom chestless starter island - `config/skyblockbuilder/templates.json5` plus a generated `default.nbt` (see [`tools/gen_starter_island.py`](../tools/gen_starter_island.py)) - replacing the built-in default. On first load, confirm the custom island loads, spawns the player correctly, and has no chest; then mark 🟢 and archive.

> Related and already fixed: the extra hotbar starter items (torch, bucket) were SkyblockBuilder's *default starter inventory* stacking on top of our grant. Emptied via `config/skyblockbuilder/starter_inventory.json5`.
